# ZikFreak 

## Project Description:
Zikfreak is a company that rents out music recording studios in the Brussels area.
They are looking for a website that provides a clear overview for clients to search for and book a music studio, as well as an admin section to manage the studios. 

## Website requirements:
- The website's landing page should provide a clear overview showcasing the featured studios with a photo and some specifications
- The landing page should have map displaying the studio's locations
- Provide a login system for members where they can create a personal profile including an option to include instruments used. 
- The specifications for the studios have to include the maximum noise level allowed, the space and the proximity
- Using the instrument details from the member profile, it should be easy to find results filtered by maximum noise levels allowed
- A separate admin section providing a system to manage the bookings and general management of the studios
